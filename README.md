# McME â€“ Minecraft Model Editor for Blockbuster's Actors

McME is a simple web based application which allow creating and editing JSON 
models for Blockbuster mod (1.3+). This web app is based on my 
[prototype](https://gist.github.com/mchorse/b567a0fbd0f9b8f80ed480c36cfea22b). 

McME supports model and texture editing

    It would be cool if Mojang would integrate my implementation of JSON entity 
    models into Minecraft *giggles* 

    Lots of people may start hating me :D
